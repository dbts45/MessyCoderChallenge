# awfulportfolio
For creating an awful website portfolio for our students to refactor the code and styles: challenge

# Current "Issues"
- CSS colours not saved as variable.
- Contact page non-existant.
- Dark Mode toggle is only one-way.
- Project page goes to projet.php.
- Pixel-sizes instead of screen-based sizes.
- Language mistakes.
- No includes, just double code all-around.
- CSS in the same file.
